               behaviour",
  author    = "Nelson, Ximena J and Fijn, Natasha",
  abstract  = "In this essay we outline how video-related technology can be
               used as a tool for studying animal behaviour. We review
               particular aspects of novel, innovative animal behaviour
               uploaded by the general public via video-based media on the
               internet (using YouTube as a specific example). The behaviour of
               animals, particularly the play behaviour focused on here, is
               viewed by huge audiences. In this essay we focused on three
               different kinds of media clips: (1) interspecies play between
               dogs and a range of other species; (2) object play in horses;
               and (3) animal responses to stimuli presented on iPads, iPods
               and iPhones. We argue that the use of video is a good means of
               capturing uncommon or previously unknown behaviour, providing
               evidence that these behaviours occur. Furthermore, some of the
               behaviours featured on YouTube provide valuable insights for
               future directions in animal behaviour research. If we also take
               this opportunity to convey our knowledge to a public that seems
               to be fundamentally interested in animal behaviour, this is a
               good means of bridging the gap between knowledge among an
               academic few and the general public.",

  abstract  = "The desire to own a pet amphibian is growing, and with it a
               growth in amphibian trade and in negative impacts on native
               populations, including disease transmission and invasive
               amphibian populations. We know very little about how or why
               people choose amphibians as pets, but amphibian owners share
               large numbers of videos on freely accessible platforms, such as
               YouTube. We aimed to use videos of captive amphibians to
               determine which species are kept, their life-history stage and
               the types of videos uploaded. We watched and categorized 1162
               videos by video type, type of amphibian behavior and amphibian
               taxonomy (superfamily, family and species). We used data on the
               amphibian trade from the Convention on International Trade in
               Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), on
               conservation status from the International Union for
               Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, and on potential
               environmental impact from published Environmental Impact
               Classification of Alien Taxa (EICAT) records, to determine
               potential conflicts of owning pet amphibians. We recorded 173
               captive species in 847 videos with a taxonomic
               overrepresentation of salamandroids and pipoids, and an
               underrepresentation of ranoids and plethodontoids. When compared
               to videos of wild amphibian species, videos of captive animals
               featured disproportionate amounts of adults feeding, being
               handled and moving. The videos watched had a smaller proportion
               of threatened amphibian species, but a higher proportion of
               invasive species, than would be expected by chance, with the
               proportion present in CITES appendices (18\%) being
               non-significant. We suggest that such data can be used to
               profile potential pets for trade and attempt to avoid conflicts
               with threatened and highly impacting alien species.",

  abstract  = "Primates are difficult to categorise due to some of the
               human-like characteristics they possess. Here, we examine the
               complexities that exist in a commensal relationship between an
               introduced population of Barbary macaques and local human
               populations on Gibraltar. In Western culture, much has been done
               to recognise primates' human characteristics while
               simultaneously focusing on keeping them at a metaphorical
               distance. In the context of Gibraltar's Barbary macaques, the
               anomalous status of primates causes a duality of perception
               whereby the macaques' position makes them both more frustrating
               and perceived as more worthy of protection. We examine the
               language used by Gibraltar residents about the macaques,
               interpreting statements using discourse analysis to reveal the
               complexities of people's perceptions of the macaques. Our
               results indicate that Barbary macaques on Gibraltar occupy a
               perceptual context of internal conflict in which they are viewed
               both with pride and a sense of ownership as well as with
               mistrust and fear. The relationship between people and Barbary
               macaques on Gibraltar is complex, and while sensitisation
               programmes and awareness-raising efforts exist, we recommend
               greater collaboration with residents to prevent the development
               of more intense negative human-macaque interactions.",
